He explains relative size, feminine touch, function ranking, the family, the ritualization of subordination, and licensed withdraw. Relative size means that the women represented in advertisements are generally shown shorter or smaller in comparison to men. Feminine touch is when a woman touches a man or an object in a way that is very loose, and not gripping the object tightly. Function ranking represents a hierarchy in the images, by way that the man is shown in front and largest in front of women and children. The family is typically depicted in a way that gives the father and a son a close relationship, and the mother and a daughter a close relationship. The ritualization of subordination is when women are shown in a lower ranking or worth of an image, and they are smaller, underneath, and overall of lesser importance to men. Finally, licensed withdrawal is when a women is shown as not interested in the camera, or looking off into the distance with head and body cant. Goffman analyzes all of these topics in a very in-depth and easy to understand format.","data":{"edits":9,"anonEdits":0,"isVandalism":false,"isNew":true,"isVolatile":false,"reverts":0,"start":"2016-12-06T18:44:06.633Z","contributors":["Powersees","Topor80","Moultonlava08","Petrasbrandon"],"anons":[],"distribution":{"Powersees":1,"Topor80":2,"Moultonlava08":5,"Petrasbrandon":1},"speed":0.9966372720192239,"anonAuthors":0,"uniqueAuthors":4,"duration":8.888933333333334,"bias":0.5555555555555556,"level":3,"trendedAt":"2016-12-06T18:53:08.455Z"}}
