The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), representing seventeen intelligence agencies, in a joint letter with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), said Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. On October 7, the DNI and DHS stated the intelligence community was confident Russia had directed Democratic National Committee (DNC) cyber-attacks and the release of its private documents. The report stated these acts were conducted in an attempt to influence the results of the U.S. election in favor of Donald Trump. Russia stated they were not involved.\nSenior U.S. officials and U.S. intelligence agencies stated they had high confidence that Russia facilitated WikiLeaks obtaining hacked emails from the DNC and Clinton campaign chair John Podesta to influence the election and elect Trump. A senior U.S. official said the conclusions were the consensus of multiple intelligence agencies. This conclusion was based on what \"many believe is overwhelming circumstantial evidence — evidence that others feel does not support firm judgments,\" obtained before the election. U.S. officials stated the conclusion was, in part, based on the belief Russia hacked the Republican National Committee (RNC), and chose not to release the content. RNC officials stated they were not hacked, and a U.S. official stated efforts to hack RNC servers had failed. A U.S. official said the FBI was uncertain as to motive, believing Russia was behind the attacks.\nOn December 9, President Barack Obama ordered a report on foreign interventions in elections going back to 2008. Republican Senators including Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain called for a bipartisan investigation. President-elect Trump rejected the intelligence report, and attacked the U.S. intelligence services in an official statement released by his transition team. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said Russia was not involved in the leaks. On December 12, Senate Majority Leader Republican Mitch McConnell said he was confident in U.S. intelligence, and placed his support behind a bipartisan investigation. McConnell announced that the Senate intelligence panel would conduct an investigation into Russia's involvement.","data":{"edits":9,"anonEdits":0,"isVandalism":false,"isNew":false,"isVolatile":false,"reverts":0,"start":"2016-12-14T04:45:34.132Z","contributors":["Darouet","FallingGravity","Sagecandor","I am One of Many"],"anons":[],"distribution":{"Darouet":2,"FallingGravity":3,"Sagecandor":3,"I am One of Many":1},"speed":0.4171082349524342,"anonAuthors":0,"uniqueAuthors":4,"duration":21.45361666666667,"bias":0.3333333333333333,"level":3,"trendedAt":"2016-12-14T05:07:08.760Z"}},

From 1989 she was the general secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), a Dravidian party whose cadre revered her as their Amma (mother) and Puratchi Thalaivi (revolutionary leader),Thanga Tharagai (Golden Maiden) among other honorifics. Critics in the media and the opposition accused her of fostering a personality cult, and of demanding absolute loyalty from AIADMK legislators and ministers who often publicly prostrated themselves before her.\nJayalalithaa first came into prominence as a leading film actor in the mid-1960s. Though she had entered the profession reluctantly, upon the urging of her mother to support the family, Jayalalithaa worked prolifically. She appeared in 140 films between 1961 and 1980, primarily in the Tamil, Telugu and Kannada languages. Jayalalithaa received praise for her versatility as an actor and for her dancing skills. She was referred as 'queen of Tamil cinema' for her immense acting ability and contribution to the industry. Among her frequent co-stars was M. G. Ramachandran, or MGR, a Tamil cultural icon who leveraged his immense popularity with the masses into a successful political career. In 1982, when MGR was chief minister, Jayalalithaa joined the AIADMK, the party he founded. Her political rise was rapid; within a few years she became AIADMK propaganda secretary and was elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India's Parliament. After MGR's death in 1987, Jayalalithaa proclaimed herself his political heir and, having fought off the faction headed by Janaki Ramachandran, MGR's widow, emerged as the sole leader of the AIADMK. Following the 1989 election, she became Leader of the Opposition to the DMK government headed by Karunanidhi.\nIn 1991 Jayalalithaa became chief minister, Tamil Nadu's youngest, for the first time. She earned a reputation for a punishing work ethic and for centralising state power among a coterie of bureaucrats; her council of ministers, whom she often shuffled around, were largely ceremonial in nature. The successful cradle-baby scheme, which enabled mothers to anonymously offer their newborns for adoption, emerged during this time. Despite an official salary of only a rupee a month, Jayalalithaa indulged in public displays of wealth, culminating in a lavish wedding for her foster son in 1995. In the 1996 election, the AIADMK was nearly wiped out at the hustings; Jayalalithaa herself lost her seat. The new Karunanidhi government quickly filed several corruption cases against her, and she had to spend time in jail. Her fortunes revived in the 1998 general election, as the AIADMK became a key component of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's 1998–99 government; her withdrawal of support toppled it and triggered another general election just a year later.\nThe AIADMK returned to power in 2001, although Jayalalithaa was personally disbarred from contesting due to the corruption cases. Within a few months of her taking oath as chief minister, in September 2001, she was disqualified from holding office, and forced to cede the chair to loyalist O. Panneerselvam. Upon her acquittal six months later, Jayalalithaa returned as chief minister to complete her term. Noted for its ruthlessness to political opponents, many of whom were arrested in midnight raids, the government grew unpopular. Another period (2006–11) in the opposition followed, before Jayalalithaa was sworn in as chief minister for the fourth time after the AIADMK swept the 2011 assembly election. Her government received attention for its extensive social-welfare agenda, which included several subsidised \"Amma\"-branded goods such as canteens, bottled water and salt. Three years into her tenure, she was convicted in a disproportionate-assets case, rendering her disqualified to hold office. She returned as chief minister after being acquitted in May 2015. In the 2016 assembly election, she became the first Tamil Nadu chief minister since MGR in 1984 to be voted back into office. That September, she fell severely ill and, following 75 days of hospitalization, died on 5 December 2016 due to cardiac arrest.","data":{"edits":17,"anonEdits":0,"isVandalism":false,"isNew":false,"isVolatile":false,"reverts":5,"start":"2016-12-05T12:07:53.760Z","contributors":["Cnu","Kavincivilion","Balacs","Giksongeorge","Prabudha.saurabh","Iamarunkumarnt","Kailash29792","Mahizhini1977","Kargayichul","Lihaas","UY Scuti","Varshan.B.P","Ramesh Ramaiah"],"anons":[],"distribution":{"Cnu":1,"Kavincivilion":1,"Balacs":1,"Giksongeorge":1,"Prabudha.saurabh":2,"Iamarunkumarnt":1,"Kailash29792":1,"Mahizhini1977":4,"Kargayichul":1,"Lihaas":1,"UY Scuti":1,"Varshan.B.P":1,"Ramesh Ramaiah":1},"speed":1.0337080018120293,"anonAuthors":0,"uniqueAuthors":13,"duration":16.429783333333333,"bias":0.23529411764705882,"level":3,"trendedAt":"2016-12-05T12:24:20.499Z"}},

On 1 July, before he was due to be sworn into office, the results of the second round of voting were annulled by the Constitutional Court of Austria due to absentee votes being improperly counted too early, requiring the election to be re-held.
