He explains relative size, feminine touch, function ranking, the family, the ritualization of subordination, and licensed withdraw. Relative size means that the women represented in advertisements are generally shown shorter or smaller in comparison to men. Feminine touch is when a woman touches a man or an object in a way that is very loose, and not gripping the object tightly. Function ranking represents a hierarchy in the images, by way that the man is shown in front and largest in front of women and children. The family is typically depicted in a way that gives the father and a son a close relationship, and the mother and a daughter a close relationship. The ritualization of subordination is when women are shown in a lower ranking or worth of an image, and they are smaller, underneath, and overall of lesser importance to men. Finally, licensed withdrawal is when a women is shown as not interested in the camera, or looking off into the distance with head and body cant. Goffman analyzes all of these topics in a very in-depth and easy to understand format.","data":{"edits":9,"anonEdits":0,"isVandalism":false,"isNew":true,"isVolatile":false,"reverts":0,"start":"2016-12-06T18:44:06.633Z","contributors":["Powersees","Topor80","Moultonlava08","Petrasbrandon"],"anons":[],"distribution":{"Powersees":1,"Topor80":2,"Moultonlava08":5,"Petrasbrandon":1},"speed":0.9966372720192239,"anonAuthors":0,"uniqueAuthors":4,"duration":8.888933333333334,"bias":0.5555555555555556,"level":3,"trendedAt":"2016-12-06T18:53:08.455Z"}},

They are a central theme in nanotechnology. Many types of quantum dot will emit light of specific frequencies if electricity or light is applied to them, and these frequencies can be precisely tuned by changing the dots' size, shape and material, giving rise to many applications.\nIn the language of materials science, nanoscale semiconductor materials tightly confine either electrons or electron holes. Quantum dots are also sometimes referred to as artificial atoms, a term that emphasizes that a quantum dot is a single object with bound, discrete electronic states, as is the case with naturally occurring atoms or molecules.\nQuantum dots exhibit properties that are intermediate between those of bulk semiconductors and those of discrete molecules. Their optoelectronic properties change as a function of both size and shape. Larger QDs (radius of 5–6 nm, for example) emit longer wavelengths resulting in emission colors such as orange or red. Smaller QDs (radius of 2–3 nm, for example) emit shorter wavelengths resulting in colors like blue and green, although the specific colors and sizes vary depending on the exact composition of the QD.\nBecause of their highly tunable properties, QDs are of wide interest. Potential applications include transistors, solar cells, LEDs, diode lasers and second-harmonic generation, quantum computing, and medical imaging. Additionally, their small size allows for QDs to be suspended in solution which leads to possible uses in inkjet printing and spin-coating. These processing techniques result in less-expensive and less time consuming methods of semiconductor fabrication.","data":{"edits":9,"anonEdits":0,"isVandalism":false,"isNew":false,"isVolatile":false,"reverts":0,"start":"2016-12-02T18:42:57.167Z","contributors":["2620 YC","2620 djb","1620 MDM","1620 rtd"],"anons":[],"distribution":{"2620 YC":5,"2620 djb":2,"1620 MDM":1,"1620 rtd":1},"speed":0.5939444068035232,"anonAuthors":0,"uniqueAuthors":4,"duration":15.049483333333335,"bias":0.5555555555555556,"level":3,"trendedAt":"2016-12-02T18:58:06.343Z"}},

They are a central theme in nanotechnology. Many types of quantum dot will emit light of specific frequencies if electricity or light is applied to them, and these frequencies can be precisely tuned by changing the dots' size, shape and material, giving rise to many applications.\nIn the language of materials science, nanoscale semiconductor materials tightly confine either electrons or electron holes. Quantum dots are also sometimes referred to as artificial atoms, a term that emphasizes that a quantum dot is a single object with bound, discrete electronic states, as is the case with naturally occurring atoms or molecules.\nQuantum dots exhibit properties that are intermediate between those of bulk semiconductors and those of discrete molecules. Their optoelectronic properties change as a function of both size and shape. Larger QDs (radius of 5–6 nm, for example) emit longer wavelengths resulting in emission colors such as orange or red. Smaller QDs (radius of 2–3 nm, for example) emit shorter wavelengths resulting in colors like blue and green, although the specific colors and sizes vary depending on the exact composition of the QD.\nBecause of their highly tunable properties, QDs are of wide interest. Potential applications include transistors, solar cells, LEDs, diode lasers and second-harmonic generation, quantum computing, and medical imaging. Additionally, their small size allows for QDs to be suspended in solution which leads to possible uses in inkjet printing and spin-coating. These processing techniques result in less-expensive and less time consuming methods of semiconductor fabrication.","data":{"edits":9,"anonEdits":0,"isVandalism":false,"isNew":false,"isVolatile":false,"reverts":0,"start":"2016-12-02T18:42:57.167Z","contributors":["2620 YC","2620 djb","1620 MDM","1620 rtd"],"anons":[],"distribution":{"2620 YC":5,"2620 djb":2,"1620 MDM":1,"1620 rtd":1},"speed":0.5939444068035232,"anonAuthors":0,"uniqueAuthors":4,"duration":15.049483333333335,"bias":0.5555555555555556,"level":3,"trendedAt":"2016-12-02T18:58:06.343Z"}},
